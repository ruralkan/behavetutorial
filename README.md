## behave Examples and Tutorials

[Tutorial](https://jenisys.github.io/behave.example/?fbclid=IwAR03FnH9oY_NTVDQ7O0XpaYHbyi3xXYco1CdLgssfUn21TkOxhEy6EMME9s)

[behave](https://pypi.org/project/behave) is BDD framework and a cucumber-clone for Python. This project provides tutorials and examples how to write tests by using behave. The examples are mostly based on the excellent behave documentation.

This project should serve as executable example how problems can be solved with behave. It should especially help new adopters.

I hope that this project helps other people to get started with behave or other Gherkin-based test frameworks, like [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) (Ruby), [jbehave](https://jbehave.org/) (Java), [lettuce](https://pypi.org/project/lettuce) (Python) or [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) (.NET).
